            <p>A head-worn apparatus that completely covers the eyes for an immersive 3D experience. Also called "VR
                goggles," VR headsets may be entirely self-contained such as the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive.They are
                costly and must be tethered to a very robust computer to handle the animation. Considerably less
                expensive units require the user's smartphone to be strapped onto the device.

                Whether within the goggles or relying on the smartphone, VR headsets use some combination of
                accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and proximity sensor to detect the user's motion. See AR headset,
                AR/VR headset, virtual reality, Oculus, Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard. </p>

                <h2>MENTAL HEALTH</h2>
                <p>This use of VR to test and tweak the brain is still very new. And with excitement around VR
                    entertainment and gaming fizzling from its 2017 peak, itâ€™s reasonable to question whether VR therapy
                    is the real deal or just another bubble. The evidence so far is strongly in favor, though, with
                    recent research suggesting psych-focused VR will live up to the hype.</p>

            <p class="cont2p">Modern virtual reality headset displays are based on technology developed for smartphones
                including: gyroscopes and motion sensors for tracking head, body, and hand positions; small HD screens
                for stereoscopic displays; and small, lightweight and fast computer processors.Virtual reality
                technology plays an important role in realizing Telesensation. Through it, a virtual world is created
                that viewers can enter and walk through and where they can handle virtual objects. The virtual world
                allows us a stereoscopic view from front or side, depending on our viewpoint, just as in the real world.
                The ability to enter and walk through the virtual world and handle virtual objects using hand gestures
                makes VR interactive, and this is one of its most important features.</p>
